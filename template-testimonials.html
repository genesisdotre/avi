<blockquote>"Dear Avi, It was quite an incredible experience to meet you this weekend and feel your unconditional love and guidance which has changed my life and feelings about myself so profoundly. It is very difficult to find words which adequately express how remarkable you are as a person and as a guide, as any words could not do justice to the precious talent of healing and intuition that you possess. I feel that since I have seen you my life has changed forever and now I am about to embark on a wonderful journey of discovery and love for myself. For this I will always be grateful. I would recommend you to anyone for such inestimable guidance. You possess a divine and precious gift."</blockquote>
