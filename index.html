									<h3>Embodying social change</h3>
									<p>There’s a lot of talk about what’s wrong in the world and the imbalances within our social systems, planetarily. Often these issues and problems are met with a mix of fear and attempts to create remediation, which are variously successful and not. From an observational perspective it's quite similar to the responses we see within personal issues in health care one experiences in today's world. We can observe the ineffectiveness of treating both personal and social issues in an isolated way, which disregards the system as an integrated whole and enables a diagnostic parallel to be drawn bridging Personal and Social Sustainability in a visible, measurable, embodied way. </p>
									<p>What is it “we” wish to sustain? Certainly those who gather at this conference are curious about social change and investigating the solutions which facilitate positive personal and social change. </p>
									<p>One of the greatest issues facing our world today is misunderstanding sustainability and the lack of consideration for future generations in our mainstream infrastructures.This planetary issue is being addressed by many from all walks of life. While exploring what it means to be and live in a life affirming sustainable environment, Avi Esther has stripped back the amalgamation of issues to its self referential foundations, meaning in order to live in a sustainable world, we must first cultivate sustainability within our selves. </p>
									<p>This self referential process is premised in the fundaments of natural elements and law which enables a grounded exploration of the implementation of sustainable solutions in every aspect of life, from the way we build to the way we govern ourselves to the way we maintain health, teach, eat, commune and live. </p>
									<p>During this presentation Avi Esther will give examples and share a few practices/ processes so everyone present can participate in an experiential, cognitive and emotional journey into the understanding full spectrum life affirming sustainability.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Elemental Evolution</h2>
									<p> How often do we appreciate the elements which make up nature or the nature which makes up ourselves?   We see, hear, feel, and experience these elements everyday of our physical lives, in the main, taking for granted the senses which enable us to navigate physical reality.  Everyone knows about the natural elements: earth, water, fire, and air… some have explored the element which brings them all together; ether.  In this talk series we will be exploring the natural elements which make up our body and sensory experience of the world we live in, in order to understand ourselves better and evolve our embodied understanding of our personal and collective evolution.</p>
