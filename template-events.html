<h2>Past Events</h2>

<h3>Embodying Social Change</h3>
<p>"Avi Esther @ Anarchapulco 2017 (February 23th - March 2nd 2017)</p>
<p>One of the greatest issues facing our world today is misunderstanding sustainability and the lack of consideration for future generations in our mainstream infrastructures. While exploring what it means to be and live in a life affirming sustainable environment, Avi Esther has stripped back the amalgamation of issues to its self referential foundations, meaning in order to live in a sustainable world, we must first cultivate sustainability within our selves."</p>
<p>There’s a lot of talk about what’s wrong in the world and the imbalances within our social systems, planetarily. Often these issues and problems are met with a mix of fear and attempts to create remediation, which are variously successful and not. From an observational perspective it's quite similar to the responses we see within personal issues in health care one experiences in today's world. We can observe the ineffectiveness of treating both personal and social issues in an isolated way, which disregards the system as an integrated whole and enables a diagnostic parallel to be drawn bridging Personal and Social Sustainability in a visible, measurable, embodied way.
What is it “we” wish to sustain? During the talk Avi Esther inspired curiosity about social change through talking about five elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Aether) and investigated the solutions, which facilitate positive personal and social change.</p>

<h3>Elemental Evolution Talks</h3>
<p>Elemental Evolution Talks @ Boheme & Radio Tulum Lab (March - April 2017)</p>
<p>Experiential Talks and Meditation Series with Radio Tulum LAB @Boheme 
Exploration of how we see, hear, feel and experience the five elements in order to understand ourselves better and evolve our embodied understanding of our personal and collective evolution.</p>

<p>How often do we appreciate the elements which make up nature or the nature which makes up ourselves?   We see, hear, feel, and experience these elements everyday of our physical lives, in the main, taking for granted the senses which enable us to navigate physical reality.  Everyone knows about the natural elements: earth, water, fire, and air… some have explored the element which brings them all together; aether. </p>

<h3>Find Your Inner Dancer</h3>
<p>Movement meditation to guide participants in expanding their perception of awareness and embody their inner dancer more authentically.

"Alchemy of Love"
Explores the elements of love and the alchemical process of personal transformation utilising the map of natural elements. Creating a morphic field of understanding for the embodied cognition of inner and outer elements. People will have the opportunity to experience in-body a sense of grounded fluidity and a softening into a greater feeling of self love and clarity of ones own personal direction by experiencing the building blocks of THE Foundation of human experience.

Dance Walking is a practice in the art of self-expression, where our bodies and spirits dance freely to music while moving through beautiful parts of London. It’s about the courage to step, shake and twirl into the lightness of being free in yourself. This inspires others to naturally drop their inhibitions and shine as they express themselves freely which is evidenced in passers-by regularly joining us as we dance.</p>
